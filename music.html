                From anime, we have been given many songs from their openings and closings of the show. Sometimes they are even so well known that even non-<br>
                anime watchers know and recognize them. On medias such as TikTok, YouTube, and Spotify there are many people who do "English covers" or <br>
                "Nightcore" versions of Japanese songs (Nightcore is essentially a sped up version of the song). It has even gone to the extent of making <br>
                games that relate to anime or Japanese music. One example is Osu!, a rhythm game based on clicking and dragging circles in time to the beat. <br>
