                From anime, we have been given many songs from their openings and closings of the show. Sometimes they are even so well known that even non-<br>
                anime-watchers know and recognize them. Anime/Japanese pop songs have definitely impacted culture all across the world. Especially on media<br>
                platforms such as youtube and spotify, there are many people who do "English covers" or "Nightcore" versions of Japanese songs (Nightcore is<br>
                essentially a speeded up version of the song). It has even gone to the extent of making games such as ones based on your rhythm skill; an <br>
                example of one is Osu!, a rhythm game based on clicking and dragging circles in time to the beat.
