        <p class="transbox">
            Manga is the Japanese term for comics. When we hear comics, we tend to think about Charlie Brown or superhero comics.<br>
            These concepts are usually viewed and enjoyed by certain groups of people. However, for the Japanese, manga has an <br>
            appeal to everyone. There is almost always something for everyone, whether it is child-friendly content, more <br>
            adult-themed content, or even slice of life or relatable content. Compared to American comics, the complexity <br> 
            of plots and diversity of genres in manga outdo them by a mile.<br>
            Here is an example of what Japanese manga would look like if you were to pick one up now (hover the image):
