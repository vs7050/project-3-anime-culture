        <h3 class="transbox"> What is Anime?</h3>
        <p class="transbox">
            Anime, the japanese way of saying "animation", has become increasingly popular in the western world<br>
            as of recent. For reference, Japanese anime is the equivalent to our cartoon shows that we see on TV.<br>
            However, it is a little different, with Japanese artists having their own style of drawing. Here is a snippet<br>
            of an anime called "That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime":

            However, typically, there would not be subtitles if you were in Japan. This version of anime is normally called "sub",<br>
            where there are subtitles to go along with the anime. Another version would be called "dub" where the anime is actually<br>
            redone by English voice actors.
