            <h3>About</h3>
                <p>
                    This website has been made to inform people who do not know much about Japanese culture/media.<br>
                    Anime, manga, and Japanese pop music have had an increase in popularity in recent years with <br>
                    media such as TikTok and YouTube being flooded with anime-related content. Personally, anime <br>
                    has been a large part of my childhood and daily life. I grew up with shows such as Dragon Ball <br>
                    and nowadays a large portion of the music I listen to includes Japanese pop or rock music.
